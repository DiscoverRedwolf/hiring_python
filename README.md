<strong>(Hiring) Full Stack Python Engineer – Tech Startup</strong>

<span>Are you a brilliant Software Engineer looking for a new opportunity with a startup company that wants to change the world?</span>
<ul>
	<li><span>$65K - $90K base salary, based on experience</span></li>
	<li><span>Here is your opportunity to affect worldwide change</span></li>
	<li><span>Be part of an incredibly intelligent team</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<b><strong>Who are these guys? </strong></b>

If Alan Turing were alive today, this company would hire him. A small and agile software startup based in Melbourne, they are looking to change the world of data security, as we know it by developing a ground breaking, cross-platform, crypto software application.

Based in the CBD, the distributed team is smart, agile and uses best practices for software development.

<b><strong> </strong></b>

<b><strong>What's this all about? </strong></b>

This is one of those rare opportunities that come along with a company that has a plan to make a positive contribution to the world and have the passion, drive and technical ability to achieve that goal. There is a great technical challenge with an element of cutting edge innovation.

The reason why there is such a large salary bracket is that the Tech Lead is willing to take on someone relatively junior (from 2 years experience) and teach him or her parts of the job.

A certain level of programming proficiency and technical ability is expected. We need someone with an ability to architect the software from a user point of view and from a developer point of view, designing libraries and classes.

Python is the preferred language of choice but a background in Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl, Smalltalk or C will also be considered. Python is apparently fairly easy to pick up (the language, not the reptile).

&nbsp;

<b><strong>Things you'd be doing:</strong></b>
<ul>
	<li><span>Architecting, developing the software solution (along with the Tech Lead)</span></li>
	<li><span>Splitting work into smaller libraries and components, writing specifications for these components</span></li>
	<li><span>Writing unit testing specs and delegating testing amongst the team</span></li>
	<li><span>Building (not designing) the User Interface</span></li>
	<li><span>Supervising and managing the offshore development team</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<b><strong>To be successful, you will need:</strong></b>
<ul>
	<li><span>A brilliant, mathematical mind and a high level of intelligence</span></li>
	<li><span>A minimum of 2 years commercially designing and building object orientated software</span></li>
	<li><span>Ability to work well with others and adhere to deadlines</span></li>
	<li><span>A background in advanced mathematics or cryptography a bonus</span></li>
	<li><span>A willingness to learn and a hunger to make a difference</span></li>
</ul>
